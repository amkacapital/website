Since our inception in 1978, we have committed ourselves to creating and maintaining properties that are both aesthetically dynamic and environmentally efficient. In keeping with this commitment, we are constantly seeking ways to improve our environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices, and we are proud of the progress we have made over the last year.</p><br/>
                    <p data-aos="fade-up-right" data-aos-duration="2000" className="para tl">Between 2015 and 2016, we achieved a 6% reduction in energy intensity across our entire global portfolio resulting in Tishman Speyer receiving the distinction of Energy Star Partner of the Year for the third year running. Additionally, over the past year, twenty of our buildings achieved certification or recertification under LEED, BREEAM, or HQE, amounting to 65 million square feet of sustainably-certified property across four continents. And in a significant shift towards greater transparency and accountability, we have prepared this report to align with GRIâ€™s sustainability reporting standards. </p><br/>

Each section of this report highlights and aspect of the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices which have enabled Tishman Speyer to maintain its reputation as an industry leader for nearly four decades.</p><br/>
